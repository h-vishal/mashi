#Module Reference - mashi.IEhacks

##ONLY FOR INTERNAL USAGE 
####Please don't load this module manually!

The module mashi.IEhacks contains all hacks for the different versions of the Microsoft Internet Explorer.

This module is loaded automatically in all Internet Explorers when another module needs a certain hack.

This way ensures, that these hacks can be disabled, in case Microsoft publishes a browser that understands standard-compliant JavaScript methods.

**Please do not edit this file!** Save own IE hacks in the 'application' directory of your Mashi app (e.g. in 'init.js').
