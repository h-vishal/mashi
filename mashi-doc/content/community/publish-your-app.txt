#Publish your app

If you want to share your Mashi app with others just use the Mashi app uploader inside the community area. We will publish your app after a short review so that it is viewable in the <a href="http://mashi.tv/gallery">Mashi gallery</a>.

This is how the Mashi app uploader works in detail:

* Zip your Mashi app directory
* Log in to the <a href="http://mashi.tv/community/people.php">Mashi commnity</a> (<a href="http://mashi.tv/community/people.php?PostBackAction=ApplyForm">sign up here</a> for free to become a Mashi community member)
* Click "Account" in the community menu, then <a href="http://mashi.tv/community/account.php?PostBackAction=MashiAppUploader">"Mashi App Uploader"</a>
* Fill out the form and click the "Upload" button. You're done.

We will recieve a short message about your upload, review it and then publish it in the Mashi gallery.

## Mashi gallery publication conditions

- The app must run in all browsers >= IE7.
- The app should not be too simple (it does not have to be a big art work though)
- The app should be safe-for-work and must not discriminate people because of their origin, color of skin or religion.
