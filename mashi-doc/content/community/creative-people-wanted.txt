#Creative people wanted!

We would greatly appreciate any participation in the Mashi project. Whether you are a developer of Mashi artwork (graphics design), Mashi plugins or the Mashi core itself, just drop us a line! (via <a href="mailto:alp@mashi.tv">email</a> or in the <a href="http://mashi.tv/community">Mashi forums</a>)

We would love to see

- Graphics designers providing Mashi users with free graphics / cliparts,
- Screenplay authors writing scripts for Mashi movies,
- Plugin developers to extend Mashi functionalities,
- Mashi core developers with a focus on security issues helping to improve the Mashi toolkit,
- Front-end developers who care for web standards and acessibility issues (speaking of <abbr title="accessibility for rich internet applications">ARIA</abbr>),
- ...and anybody with great ideas and visions regarding the future development of the Mashi toolkit.
