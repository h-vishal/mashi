#Roadmap

####New Module: Debugger

There allready exists a debugger you can load while creating a Mashi app. We are testing the debugger intensively. The debugger shows data like count of frames and the app duration in real-time. Mashi apps with controls can be conrolled from within the debugger.

The debugger will also provide the functionality of a JavaScript console in future.

####New Module: Text Effects

There are 2 plugins that provide new text effects. These effects will be summed up into a new module and therefore be available for future versions of the Mashi toolkit.

####New Module: Keyboard Control

We allready have a module called 'keyboard'. But we would like to discuss severall issues regarding the accessibility of this module before we publish it.

<a href="http://mashi.tv/community/?CategoryID=5">Please tell us your thought about this in the forums</a>

####Optimization of the slideshow module

The slideshow module is based on div elements for each slide. This is the reason why you can not use nested div elements in presentations right now. We want to provide a configuration file where authors can set the structure for the XML document to avoid this limitation. There will also be a full screen mode for presentations.

####Better Accessibility

Mashi apps are completely inaccessible for disabled users right now. The W3C has recommondation called <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria">WAI-ARIA</a> that could solve this problem. Anybody interested in implementing WAI-ARIA into Mashi can drop us a line.
