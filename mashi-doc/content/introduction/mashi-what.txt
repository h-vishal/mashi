#What is Mashi?

#####Mashi brings a new dimension to the web 

Web pages are 2 dimensional like texts and images. Interactions are normally started by users (onclick, onfocus, ..). But there is no satisfactory way to control time-dependent actions. There are native JavaScript methods for 'window' objects like 'setTimeout' and 'setInterval'. But when you try to make a complex animation with lot of frames, you need to nest these methods. The more you nest these methods the more confusing and unmanageable the code becomes.

Mashi allows you to set up scenes (frames) with a fixed period and where specified actions are performed. You can combine frames to framesets and save them in one or more files. Framesets can also be loaded through AJAX dynamically, if wanted.

Actions of each scene are set in the 'main' function. JavaScript savvy developers can use their favorite framework (ours is jQuery) to integrate own methods and so manipulate any element of a web page in precisely defined temporal sequence.


#####Is Mashi only for developers?

**No!** Mashi is designed for non-developers so that graphics designers, story tellers and e-learning authors can easily learn the manageable number of JavaScript methods (see core and module methods reference). Layout and styling of the objects are made with Cascading Stylesheets (CSS). Please use the large number of CSS tutorials (e.g. http://www.w3schools.com/css/) on the internet to learn more about CSS.

#####Don't I need a plugin for that?

**No!** A Mashi app has everything needed to run in a standards compliant web browser. A Mashi app consists of a 'system' and a 'application' directory and in some cases a 'plugins' directory. The Mashi player, modules, system graphics and styles are located in the 'system' directory. The contents of the Mashi app itself (like frames, images and layouts/styles) are in the 'application' directory.
